.# Abstract

This document defines data objects for the RESTful Provisioning Protocol (RPP) and sets up IANA RPP Data Object Registry to describe and catalogue them. Specifically, it details the logical structure, constraints, and protocol operations (including their inputs, outputs and business logic) for foundational resources: domain names, contacts, and hosts. In accordance with the RPP architecture [@!I-D.kowalik-rpp-architecture], these definitions focus entirely on the semantics, remaining independent of any specific data representation or media type (e.g., JSON or XML).

# Introduction
The RESTful Provisioning Protocol (RPP) defines a set of data objects used to represent and manage foundational registry resources, including domain names, contacts, and hosts. This initial list is not exhaustive; additional resource and component objects MAY be defined in future revisions or introduced via IANA registration to support new features and operational needs.

In accordance with the RPP architecture [@!I-D.kowalik-rpp-architecture], a core architectural principle is the clear distinction between the abstract data model and its concrete data representation. The data model defines the logical structure, relationships, and constraints of the objects, independent of formatting. The data representation defines how these abstract concepts are expressed in specific formats (e.g., JSON, XML, or YAML).

This document focuses on the data model of RPP objects and operations on them, including the data model of operation inputs, outputs as well as the necessary business logic of state transitions. This separation of concerns ensures the protocol maintains a stable semantic foundation that can be consistently implemented across different media types and easily adapted to new representation formats. For instance, the model defines a contact's name as a required string type, but it remains agnostic as to whether that string is ultimately encoded as a JSON property or an XML element.

## Conventions and Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [@!RFC2119] [@!RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

The following terms related to the relationship between host objects and domain objects are used as defined in [@!RFC5732, section 1.1]:

* Subordinate host: A host name object that has a subordinate relationship to a superordinate domain name object. For example, host name "ns1.example.com" has a subordinate relationship to domain name "example.com".
* Superordinate domain: A domain name object to which a host name object is subordinate.
* Internal host: A host whose name belongs to the namespace of the repository in which the host is being used for delegation purposes.
* External host: A host whose name does not belong to the namespace of the repository in which the host is being used for delegation purposes.

The following terms are defined and used in this document

Object Authorisation
: Authorisation data related to the object beyond the default client-level authorisation accompanying the request, in order to authorise operations on the object. Typically it is a value related to or derived from an Authorisation Information Object provisioned with the object.

Data Object
: A top-level provisioned resource object that has an independent lifecycle and identity in the registry. Data Objects carry data elements describing the resource and define the set of operations that can be performed on them.

Component Object
: A reusable data structure that carries data only, with no operations of its own. Component Objects are embedded within Data Objects or other objects to avoid repetition of common data patterns.

Process Object
: An object that represents a long-running or multi-step operation initiated on a Data Object. Process Objects carry operation-related state and data, and may define their own operations to interact with the process. They have no independent existence - their lifecycle is bound to the owning Data Object.

Owner Data Object
: A Data Object which a process (represented as Process Object) was initiated upon and which owns this Process Object

# Resource Definition Principles

## Primitive Data Types

RPP data elements use strict typing, meaning that each element must conform exactly to its declared primitive data type, and type violations MUST be treated as errors by implementations. The exact specifications for these types, including allowed ranges, encoding, and formatting, are determined by the representation format used (e.g., JSON, XML, CBOR). New RPP non-primitive data types based on existing primitive data types MAY be defined to support additional features.

### String

A String is a sequence of Unicode characters. Usages MAY impose additional constraints on string values, such as maximum length or allowed character sets, based on specific data element definitions. An example of a string is `"host.example"`.

### Integer

An Integer is a whole number, positive or negative. Usages MAY impose additional constraints on integer values, such as minimum and maximum allowable values, based on specific data element definitions. An example of an integer is `42`.

### Boolean

A Boolean represents a logical true or false value. An example of a boolean is `true` or `false`, but it MAY be different depending on the native encoding of boolean values in the representation.

### Decimal

 Decimal is a number providing an exact, base-10 representation of fractional values within a defined precision. Usage of this type MUST impose additional constraints on decimal values, such as precision or range, based on specific data element definitions. An example of a decimal is 3.14159.

### Date

A Date is a full-date calendar date as described in [@!RFC3339], an example of a date is `2025-10-27`.

### Timestamp

Timestamp (Date and time attribute) values MUST be represented in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) using the Gregorian calendar using date-time form as defined in [@!RFC3339]. In EPP Compatibility Profile upper case "T" and "Z" characters MUST be used. An example of a timestamp is `2025-10-27T09:42:51Z`.

### URL

A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) as defined in [@!RFC1738]. An example of a URL is `"https://host.example"`.

### Binary

Raw binary data, implementations MAY choose how to encode the binary data, for example as base64 or hexadecimal string. An example of binary data encoded as base64 is `"UlBQIFNheXMgSGk="`.

### Dictionary

Notation: Dictionary[Value Type]

A Dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs where keys are unique Strings and values are of the specified primitive data type. Usages MUST define the constraints on allowed keys and values. A Dictionary differs from an Aggregation Dictionary in that it maps String keys to primitive values rather than to Component or Resource Objects.

### Object

An Object is a composite structure containing named properties. The set of allowed property names, their data types, and their constraints are determined by the data element definition that uses this type. Usages MUST specify the expected structure, including any required or optional properties. An Object differs from a Component Object in that it is defined inline as part of a data element rather than being a standalone reusable definition registered separately.

## Data Element Abstraction

Each data object is composed of logical data elements. A data element is a logical unit of information identified by a stable name, independent of its representation in any given media type. The definition for each element specifies its logical name, purpose, cardinality, data type, and constraints.
The data type of a data element may also be a reference to another data object, using the target object's stable name.

## Extensibility

The RPP data model is designed to be extensible. Extensions MAY introduce new data objects, add new data elements or associations to existing objects, and define new operations or extend the inputs and outputs of existing operations with additional transient data elements.

### Standardised and Private Extensions

RPP distinguishes between standardised and private extensions:

* Standardised extensions MUST be registered with IANA, as described in the IANA Considerations section of this document and in [@!I-D.ietf-rpp-architecture]. Registration ensures global uniqueness of extension identifiers and promotes interoperability across implementations.

* Private (non-standardised) extensions MAY be defined for use within specific implementations or organisations. Private extensions are not required to be registered with IANA, but MUST still use unique identifiers that are unlikely to conflict with standardised extensions or other private extensions. The use of reverse domain notation as a prefix (e.g., `org.example.rpp.myElement`) is RECOMMENDED for private extension identifiers to avoid naming collisions.

### Extension Points

The following aspects of the data model are extensible:

* New data objects: Additional resource or component objects MAY be defined by extensions and registered with IANA.
* New data elements: Extensions MAY add new data elements to existing data objects. Such elements follow the same Data Element Semantics as core data elements.
* New associations: Extensions MAY introduce new associations between existing or new objects.
* New operations: Extensions MAY define entirely new operations on existing or new data objects.
* Extended operation inputs and outputs: Extensions MAY add new transient data elements to the inputs or outputs of existing operations.

When an extension adds data elements or transient parameters to a core object or operation, these additions MUST NOT alter the semantics or constraints of existing core data elements.

## Data Element Semantics

The definition of each data element within an object consists of the following attributes:

* Name: A human-readable name for the data element.
* Identifier: A machine-readable, unique identifier for the element, using camelCase notation.
* Cardinality: Specifies the number of times an element may appear. The notation is as follows:
  * `1` for exactly one
  * `0-1` for zero or one
  * `0+` for zero or more
  * and `1+` for one or more
* Data Type: Defines the element's data structure, which can be a primitive type, a Common Data Type or a reference to another component object.
* Description: Explains the purpose of the data element and any other relevant information.
* Constraints: Provides specific validation rules or limitations on top of the data type itself, such as value ranges.
* Mutability: Defines the lifecycle of the data element's value. It MUST be one of the following:
  * create-only: The element's value is provided during the object's creation and cannot be modified thereafter.
  * read-only: The element's value is managed by the server. It cannot be set or modified directly by the client, though it may change as a result of server-side operations.
  * read-write: The element's value can be set and modified by the client.

## Operations

For each data object a set of possible operations is defined together with their respective input and output data.

### Authorisation

For each operation authorisation requirements and operation behaviour is specified.

Wherever "Object Authorisation" is mentioned, it means that an operation MAY accept or require additional authorisation data related to the object beyond default client-level authorisation, or that an operation MAY result in different processing or response if such authorisation is provided.

### Uniform interface

For the typical set of Create, Read, Update and Delete operations the following set of input and output data model is specified on top of additional transient input data, unless an operation for the specific object tells otherwise.

#### Create

* Input: Object (create-only and read-write properties)
* Output: Object (read-write and read-only properties)

#### Read

* Input: Object identifier
* Output: Object (read-write and read-only properties)

The output Object MAY vary depending on the identity of the querying client, use of Object Authorisation information, and server policy towards unauthorised clients.

If the querying client is the sponsoring client, all available information MUST be returned.

If the querying client is not the sponsoring client but the client provides valid Object Authorisation information, all available information SHOULD be returned, however some optional elements MAY be reserved to the sponsoring client only. 

If the querying client is not the sponsoring client and the client does not provide valid Object Authorisation information, server policy determines which OPTIONAL elements are returned, if any, or whether the entire request is rejected.

#### Update

* Input: Object identifier, Object changes (read-write properties)
* Output: Object (read-write and read-only properties)

#### Delete

* Input: Object identifier
* Output: Object (read-write and read-only properties) or nothing

### Operations beyond uniform interface

For all other operations both input and output have to be fully specified.

### Transfer Operations {#transfer-operations}

Transfer operations manage the change of sponsorship of a provisioned object from one client (the sponsoring client) to another (the gaining client). They are specified once in this section as the transfer model is common across all transferable resource objects. Individual object definitions reference this section and specify any object-specific extensions to the common pattern.

RPP supports two types of transfer:

* Pull Transfer: Initiated by the gaining client. The gaining client MUST provide valid Object Authorisation to initiate the request.
* Push Transfer: Initiated by the sponsoring client, who designates a gaining client in the request.

The transfer process MAY be immediate or follow a multi-step workflow depending on server policy. If the server implements immediate transfers, the Approve and Reject operations need not be supported; the server completes the transfer upon receipt of the Create operation.

The server MAY implement local policies to prevent transfers from stalling and implement a form of automated transfer escalation, approval or cancellation when such a stalled process is recognised.

All transfer operations act on or return the Transfer Process Object and are executed in the context of Owner Data Object the operation is created upon.

A> TODO: The server MUST notify the current sponsoring client of a pending transfer request. The notification mechanism is not defined in this document.

A> TODO: Transfer-specific error conditions (object not eligible for transfer, object pending transfer, object not pending transfer) are not defined in this document.

### Restore Operations {#restore-ops}

Restore operations manage the recovery of an object that has entered the Redemption Grace Period (RGP). They are OPTIONAL and are only available when the RGP feature is supported by the server and MAY be supported only for a subset of Data Object types.

The RGP process MAY involve two distinct steps:

* Restore Request: (REQUIRED) Initiates the recovery of an object in the `redemptionPeriod` state, signalling to the registry the intent to restore. This corresponds to the Create operation on the Restore Process Object. On success, the object transitions to `pendingRestore`.
* Restore Report: (OPTIONAL) Submits a report documenting the circumstances of the deletion and restoration, as required by registry policy. This corresponds to the Report operation on the Restore Process Object. On success, the object is returned to its pre-deletion status and all RGP status labels are removed.

Whether a restore report is required after a restore request is a matter of server policy. If the server does not require a restore report, the object returns to its pre-deletion status immediately upon a successful Create operation, bypassing the `pendingRestore` state.

The Create operation MAY include the restore report inline to complete both steps atomically in a single operation.

All restore operations act on or return the Restore Process Object and are executed in the context of Owner Data Object the operation is created upon.

#### Redemption Grace Period State Diagram

The following state diagram describes the object lifecycle when the Redemption Grace Period (RGP) feature is supported. It adapts the diagram from [@!RFC3915, section 2] to the RPP data model, using RPP status labels and operations instead of EPP command names.

In the diagram below, RPP status labels are shown in the `status` field of the object. Standard EPP-origin status labels (e.g., `ok`, `pendingDelete`) are used alongside the RGP-specific labels defined in this document. The `<create>` and `<report>` labels refer to the Create and Report operations on the Restore Process Object, replacing the EPP extended `<update>` command with `op=request` and `op=report` attributes.

```ascii

   |                                  <create>    | +-----------------------+
   +----------------------------------------------+
```

State descriptions:

1. The object is in normal operation (`ok` or other status allowing a delete operation).
2. A delete operation is received and processed.
3. RGP begins. The object enters `pendingDelete` + `redemptionPeriod` state. The object remains here until a restore operation is requested or the redemption period elapses.
4. A restore Create operation is submitted. The registry accepts the request. Go to step 8 if the redemption period elapses before a restore is received (4a).
5. If the server does not require a restore report, the object returns to its pre-deletion status (1) immediately upon a successful Create operation. If the server requires a report but the client includes it inline in the Create operation, the server processes both atomically and the object transitions directly from `redemptionPeriod` to its pre-deletion status (1), bypassing the `pendingRestore` state.
6. The object enters `pendingDelete` + `pendingRestore` state. The registry awaits a restore report from the sponsoring client.
7. If no restore report is received within the registry-defined time, the object returns to `redemptionPeriod` state (step 3).
8. If a restore report is received and accepted, the object returns to its pre-deletion status and all RGP status labels are removed.
9. The redemption period elapses without a restore request being received.
10. The object enters `pendingDelete` + `rgpPendingDelete` state and awaits final purge processing.
11. The pending delete period elapses and the object is purged.
12. The object is purged and available for re-registration.

## EPP Compatibility Profile

RPP is designed to coexist with the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), often operating in parallel against a common backend provisioning system. While RPP is not inherently constrained by all of EPP's requirements, a specific set of rules is necessary to ensure seamless interoperability in such mixed environments.

To address this, this document defines an "EPP Compatibility Profile". This profile specifies a set of additional constraints on RPP data objects and operations that a server MUST adhere to when supporting both RPP and EPP concurrently.

Throughout this document, all constraints that are part of this profile are explicitly marked with a reference to "EPP Compatibility Profile". Implementers of systems in a mixed EPP/RPP environment MUST follow these specific constraints in addition to the base RPP requirements.

# Common Data Types

This section defines new shared data types and structures that are re-used across multiple data object definitions and are based on the existing Primitive Data Types.

## Identifier

Identifiers are character strings with a specified minimum length, a specified maximum length, and a specified format outlined in [@!RFC5730, section 2.8]. Identifiers for certain object types MAY have additional constraints imposed either by server policy, object specific specifications or both.

## Client Identifier

Client identifiers are character strings with a specified minimum length, a specified maximum length, and a specified format. Contact identifiers use the "clIDType" client identifier syntax described in [@!RFC5730].

A> TBC: do we need this or is it a relation with an entity/RFC8543 organisation? If registrars modeled are as first class objects (organisations), then clID is nothing else but a reference to this organisation, so maybe no need to define syntax separately on identifier level (or in other words it would be defined on this object). R8.1 in the form of -02 RPP requirements includes RFC8543. 

## Phone Number

Telephone number syntax is derived from structures defined in [@!ITU.E164.2005].  Telephone numbers described in this specification are character strings that MUST begin with a plus sign ("+", ASCII value 0x002B), followed by a country code defined in [@!ITU.E164.2005], followed by a dot (".", ASCII value 0x002E), followed by a sequence of digits representing the telephone number.  An optional "x" (ASCII value 0x0078) separator with additional digits representing extension information can be appended to the end of the value.

# Associations

RPP allows for different types of associations (relationship) between the objects. The association may be added between 2 objects with own independent lifecycle (UML aggregation) or in the relation when one object's existence and lifecycle is bound to the other parent/owner object (UML composition).
In both cases, especially if the relation allows for cardinality higher than one on either side, the association may be assigned additional attributes, not being part of an object on either side of relation. In many cases such relation would be attributed with a single text string label, describing a role or a type of relation. Depending on the context this value might be unique, which allows using such label as a key in a dictionary.

The following generic Association Types are defined for RPP:

## Aggregation

Notation: Aggregation[Type]

A relation between two independent objects.

If the cardinality of target object is more than 1, this represents an ordered array.
It MUST be assured that the same unchanged data is always inserted in the same order in order to allow stable reference by position to data elements. In case of data insertions, deletions or updates the remaining of the data SHALL preserve its order.

Example aggregation having cardinality 1:

```ascii
+-------------------+
|   (root parent)   |
|-------------------|
| foo:              |
|   |         +----------+
|   +-------- | [Object] |
|             |    ...   |
|             +----------+
+-------------------+
```

Example aggregation having cardinality >1:

```ascii
+-------------------+
|   (root parent)   |
|-------------------|
| foo:              |
|   +-----[0] +----------+
|   |         | [Object] |
|   |         |    ...   |
|   |         +----------+
|   +-----[1] +----------+
|             | [Object] |
|             |    ...   |
|             +----------+
|         ...       |
+-------------------+
```

## Composition

Notation: Composition[Type] or Type

A relation between an independent parent object and 1 or more dependent child object(s).

If the cardinality of target object is more than 1, this represents an ordered array.
It MUST be assured that the same unchanged data is always inserted in the same order in order to allow stable reference by position to data elements. In case of data insertions, deletions or updates the remaining of the data SHALL preserve its order.

Example composition having cardinality 1:

```ascii
+-------------------+
|      (root)       |
|-------------------|
| foo:              |
|   |  +-------+    |
|   +--| ...   |    |
|      +-------+    |
+-------------------+
```

Example composition having cardinality >1:

```ascii
+-------------------+
|      (root)       |
|-------------------|
| foo:              |
|   +-[0] +-------+ |
|   |     | ...   | |
|   |     +-------+ |
|   +-[1] +-------+ |
|   |     | ...   | |
|   |     +-------+ |
|   ...             |
+-------------------+
```

## Labelled Aggregation

Notation: LabelledAggregation[Type]

A relation between two independent object with single text string attribute. Multiple associations with the same label are allowed and represent an unordered array.

A type defining such association MUST define Label Description with semantics of the label and Label Constraints with constraints related to the label.

Example labelled aggregation:

```ascii
+--------------------------------+
|             (root)             |
|--------------------------------|
| foo:                           |
|   |                            |
|   +---("label_A")--->  +----------+
|   |                    | [Object] |
|   |                    |   ...    |
|   |                    +----------+
|   +---("label_B")--->  +----------+
|   |                    | [Object] |
|   |                    |   ...    |
|   |                    +----------+
|   +---("label_A")--->  +----------+
|   |  (labels repeat)   | [Object] |
|   |                    |   ...    |
|   |                    +----------+
|   ...                          |
+--------------------------------+

```

## Dictionary Aggregation

Notation: DictionaryAggregation[Type]

A relation between two independent object with single text string attribute. Association labels MUST be unique allowing it to be used as dictionary key.

A type defining such association MUST define Label Description with semantics of the label and Label Constraints with constraints related to the label.

Example Dictionary Aggregation:

```ascii
+--------------------------+
|         (root)           |
|--------------------------|
| foo:                     |
|   "key1" ->       +-----------+
|                   | [Object]  |
|                   |   ...     |
|                   +-----------+
|   "key2" ->       +-----------+
|                   | [Object]  |
|                   |   ...     |
|                   +-----------+
|     ...                  |
+--------------------------+
```

## Labelled Composition

Notation: LabelledComposition[Type]

A relation between an independent parent object and a dependent child object with single text string attribute. Multiple associations with the same label are allowed.

A type defining such association MUST define Label Description with semantics of the label and Label Constraints with constraints related to the label.

Example Labelled Composition:

```ascii
+-------------------------------------+
|        (root parent)                |
|-------------------------------------|
| foo:                                |
|   |                                 |
|   +---("label_A")--->  +----------+ |
|   |                    | [Child]  | |
|   |                    |   ...    | |
|   |                    +----------+ |
|   +---("label_B")--->  +----------+ |

## Dictionary Composition

Notation: DictionaryComposition[Type]

A relation between an independent parent object and a dependent child object with single text string attribute. Only single association with the same label is allowed allowing it to be used as dictionary key.

A type defining such association MUST define Label Description with semantics of the label and Label Constraints with constraints related to the label.

Example Dictionary Composition:
```ascii
+--------------------------+
|         (root)           |
|--------------------------|
| foo:                     |
|   "key1" -> +---------+  |
|             | [Child] |  |
|             |   ...   |  |
|             +---------+  |
|   "key2" -> +---------+  |
|             | [Child] |  |
|             |   ...   |  |
|             +---------+  |

        * `rgpPendingDelete`: The redemption period has elapsed without a successful restore. The object has entered the purge processing state. This status value MUST only appear alongside the standard `pendingDelete` status. This label is used to distinguish the RGP-specific pending-delete sub-state from the broader EPP `pendingDelete` status.

### RDATA Structures in EPP Profile {#rdata-structures}

This section defines the RDATA field structures required for interoperability in the EPP Compatibility Profile.

In EPP Compatibility Profile ([@!RFC5732]), the following RDATA structures MUST be supported:

* For NS records ([@!RFC1035], Section 3.3.11): `nsdname` (the fully qualified domain name of the name server).
* For A records ([@!RFC1035], Section 3.4.1): `address` (the IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation).
* For AAAA records ([@RFC3596], Section 2.2): `address` (the IPv6 address in text representation as defined in [@!RFC5952]).

In EPP Compatibility Profile with DNSSEC Extension ([@RFC5910]), the following RDATA structures MUST additionally be supported:

* For DS records ([@RFC4034], Section 5): `keyTag` (key tag value), `algorithm` (algorithm number), `digestType` (digest algorithm type), and `digest` (digest value).
* For DNSKEY records ([@RFC4034], Section 2): `flags` (flags field value), `protocol` (protocol field value), `algorithm` (algorithm number), and `publicKey` (encoded public key value).

A> TBC: Optional keyData inside dsData (RFC 5910 Section 4.1): In the DS Data Interface, a DS record MAY optionally contain a nested keyData element used for server-side validation of the DS hash. The draft doesn't describe this pattern - a client submitting a DS record with accompanying DNSKEY for validation.

## DNS Operational Controls Object

    * Mutability: read-write
    * Data Type: Dictionary[Integer]
    * Description: Specifies a child's preference for the maximum number of seconds after signature generation when the parent's signature on signed DNS information should expire. The dictionary is keyed by lower-case record type name, with values representing the maximum signature lifetime in seconds for that record type. The value applies to the RRSIG resource record over the signed DNS RRset. See Section 3 of [@RFC4034] for information on the RRSIG resource record. This corresponds to the maxSigLife concept from [@RFC5910].
    * Constraints:
      * The keys MUST be valid DNS resource record type names in lower case.
      * The values MUST be positive Integers (minimum value of 1).

* Registration Period
  * Identifier: period
  * Cardinality: 0-1
  * Data Type: Period Object.
  * Description: The initial registration period for the domain name. This value is used by the server to calculate the initial `expiryDate` of the object. This element is not persisted as part of the object's state. 

### Read Operation

* Identifier: read

The Read operation allows a client to retrieve the data elements of a Domain Name resource. The server's response MAY vary depending on client authorisation and server policy.

* Authorisation:
  * Sponsoring client:
    * Full object
  * Other client:
    * Without Object Authorisation:
      * Limited object (non-confidential properties) or operation denied
    * With Object Authorisation:
      * Full object, however some properties only authorised to the sponsoring client MAY be redacted according to server policy

The following transient data elements are defined for this operation:

* Hosts Filter
  * Identifier: hostsFilter
  * Cardinality: 0-1
  * Data Type: String
  * Description: Controls which host information is returned with
the object.

### Update Operation

The Update operation allows a client to modify the read-write data elements of an existing Domain Name resource.

* Authorisation:
  * Only sponsoring client is authorised to perform this operation

The following transient data elements are defined for this operation:

* Urgent
  * Identifier: urgent
  * Cardinality: 0-1
  * Data Type: Boolean
  * Description: Requests that the server operator process and implement the update with high priority. "High priority" is relative to standard server operator policies determined using an out-of-band mechanism. In EPP Compatibility Profile this corresponds to the "urgent" attribute of the `<secDNS:update>` element defined in [@RFC5910]. The default value is `false`.
  * Constraints:
    * A server that does not support this parameter MUST return an error if it is set to `true`.
    * A server that supports this parameter but cannot fulfil a specific urgent request MUST return an error.

### Delete Operation

* Identifier: delete

The Delete operation allows a client to remove an existing Domain Name resource. The operation targets a specific data object identified by its name.

* Authorisation:
  * Only sponsoring client is authorised to perform this operation

The server SHOULD reject a delete request if subordinate host objects are associated with the domain name.

The error response SHOULD indicate the related subordinate host objects.

### Renew Operation

* Identifier: renew

The Renew operation allows a client to extend the validity period of an existing Domain Name resource. The operation targets a specific data object identified by its name.

* Authorisation:
  * Only sponsoring client is authorised to perform this operation

* Input: Domain Name
* Output: Full object (read-write and read-only properties), or a minimum set of properties affected by the operation (Expiry Date).

The following transient data elements are defined for this operation:

* Current Expiry Date
  * Identifier: currentExpiryDate
  * Cardinality: 1

* Renewal Period
  * Identifier: renewalPeriod
  * Cardinality: 0-1
  * Data Type: Period Object
  * Description: The duration to be added to the object's registration period. This value is used by the server to calculate the new `expiryDate`. The default value MAY be defined by server policy. The number of units available MAY be subject to limits imposed by the server.

### Transfer Operations

The Domain Name Data Object supports the common transfer operations defined in the (#transfer-operations). The transfer of a domain name changes the sponsoring client of the domain object.

Transfer of a domain object MUST implicitly transfer all host objects that are subordinate to the domain object. For example, if domain object "example.com" is transferred and host object "ns1.example.com" exists, the host object MUST be transferred as part of the "example.com" transfer process.

In addition to the common Transfer Process Object elements, the following object-specific `create-only` data element is defined and can be provided when creating a Transfer Process Object for a domain name:

* Transfer Period
  * Identifier: transferPeriod
  * Cardinality: 0-1

A> TBC: IANA registry for statuses?

## Operations

### Create Operation

The Create operation allows a client to provision a new Contact resource. The operation accepts as input all create-only and read-write data elements defined for the Contact Data Object.

* Authorisation:
  * Generally each client is authorised to create new contact objects becoming a sponsoring client. This can be however constrained by the server policy, e.g. by applying rate limiting or compliance locks.

In EPP Compatibility Profile, the following data elements MUST be provided:

* Handle ID (`id`)
* At least one Postal Information entry (`postalInfo`) containing a Name (`name`) and an Address (`addr`) with City (`city`) and Country Code (`cc`)
* E-mail (`email`)
* Authorisation Information (`authInfo`)

### Read Operation

The Read operation allows a client to retrieve the data elements of a Contact resource. The server's response MAY vary depending on client authorisation and server policy.

* Authorisation:
  * Sponsoring client:
    * Full object
  * Other client:
    * Without Object Authorisation:
      * Limited object (non-confidential properties) or operation denied
    * With Object Authorisation:
      * Full object, however some properties only authorised to the sponsoring client MAY be redacted according to server policy

Authorisation Information (`authInfo`) MUST NOT be provided in the response if the querying client is not the current sponsoring client.

When constructing the response, the server MUST respect the disclosure policies defined by the Disclose Object (`disclose`), whether set by the server operator's default data-collection policy or by the sponsoring client for the contact. Data elements marked for non-disclosure MUST NOT be included in responses to unauthorised clients.

### Update Operation

The Update operation allows a client to modify the attributes of an existing Contact resource.

* Authorisation:
  * Only sponsoring client is authorised to perform this operation

The following aspects of the contact object MAY be modified:

* Status values that are client-manageable (prefixed with "client") MAY be added or removed.
* Postal Information, Voice Phone Number, Fax Phone Number, E-mail, Authorisation Information, and Disclose preferences MAY be changed.

A client MUST NOT add, delete or alter values for statuses managed by the server (prefixed with "server"). A server MAY add, delete or alter status values set by a client, subject to server policy.

### Delete Operation

The Delete operation allows a client to remove an existing Contact resource. The operation targets a specific data object identified by its Handle ID.

* Authorisation:
  * Only sponsoring client is authorised to perform this operation

The server SHOULD reject a delete request if the contact object is associated with other known objects (e.g., domain names). An associated contact SHOULD NOT be deleted until associations with other known objects have been broken.

The error response SHOULD indicate the existing object associations.

### Transfer Operations

The Contact Data Object supports the common transfer operations defined in the (#transfer-operations). The transfer of a contact changes the sponsoring client of the contact object.

No object-specific transient data elements are defined for contact transfer operations beyond the common transfer data elements.

# Host Data Object

## Object Description

* Name: Host Data Object
* Identifier: host
* Description: A Host Data Object represents a name server that provides DNS services for a domain name.

## Data Elements

The following data elements are defined for the Host Data Object.

* Host Name
  * Identifier: hostName
  * Cardinality: 1
  * Mutability: read-write
  * Data Type: String
  * Description: Fully qualified name of a host.
  * Constraints: The value MUST be a syntactically valid host name.

* Provisioning Metadata
  * Identifier: provMetadata
  * Cardinality: 1
  * Mutability: read-only
  * Data Type: Provisioning Metadata Object
  * Description: Standard metadata about the object's lifecycle and ownership.
  * Constraints: (None)

* Status
  * Identifier: status
  * Cardinality: 0+
  * Mutability: read-only
  * Data Type:  Status Object
  * Description: The current status descriptors associated with the host.
  * Constraints: Possible combinations of Host Status Labels is specified in [@!RFC5732, section 2.3]

* DNS Data
  * Identifier: dns
  * Cardinality: 0-1
  * Mutability: read-write
  * Data Type: DNS Data Object
  * Description: DNS resource records and operational controls related to the host. This structure follows the unified DNS data model defined in [@I-D.simmen-rpp-dns-data].
  * Constraints:
    * The names of DNS entries MUST be the host name itself or subordinate to the host name.
    * In EPP Compatibility Profile the record entries MUST be limited to A and AAAA entries for IPv4 and IPv6 glue records respectively.

## Operations

### Create Operation

The Create operation allows a client to provision a new Host Data Object. The operation accepts as input all create-only and read-write data elements defined for the Host Data Object.

* Authorisation:
  * Generally each client is authorised to create new host objects becoming a sponsoring client. This can be however constrained by the server policy, e.g. by applying rate limiting or compliance locks.

If the host name exists in a namespace for which the server is authoritative, then the superordinate domain of the host MUST be known to the server before the host object can be created.

In EPP Compatibility Profile, IP addresses are REQUIRED only as needed to produce DNS glue records. If the host name exists in a namespace for which the server is authoritative and is subordinate to an existing domain, IP addresses SHOULD be provided. If the host name is external to the server's namespace, IP addresses are not required by the DNS and MAY be omitted.

### Read Operation

The Read operation allows a client to retrieve the data elements of a Host Data Object.

* Authorisation:
  * Any client is authorised to retrieve the full object. In EPP Compatibility Profile, host objects do not carry authorisation information and there is no distinction based on client identity as described in [@!RFC5732, section 3.1.2].

### Update Operation

The Update operation allows a client to modify the attributes of an existing Host Data Object. The operation targets a specific data object identified by its host name.

* Authorisation:
  * Only sponsoring client is authorised to perform this operation

Host name changes MAY require the addition or removal of IP addresses to be accepted by the server. IP address association MAY be subject to server policies for provisioning hosts as name servers.

Host name changes can have an impact on associated objects that refer to the host object. A Host Name change SHOULD NOT require additional updates of associated objects to preserve existing associations, with one exception: changing an external host object that has associations with objects that are sponsored by a different client. Attempts to update such hosts directly MUST fail. The change can be provisioned by creating a new external host with a new name and any needed new attributes, and subsequently updating the other objects sponsored by the client.

### Delete Operation

The Delete operation allows a client to remove an existing Host Data Object. The operation targets a specific data object identified by its host name.

* Authorisation:
  * Only sponsoring client is authorised to perform this operation

The server SHOULD reject a delete request if the host object is associated with any other object, such as a domain name object. Deleting a host object without first breaking existing associations can cause DNS resolution failure for domain objects that refer to the deleted host object.

A> TODO: consider RFC 9874 / BCP 244 for host deletions practices

The error response SHOULD indicate the related associated objects.

### Restore Operations

The Host Data Object supports the restore operations defined in the (#restore-ops). These operations are OPTIONAL and are only available when the RGP feature for Host Data Object is supported by the server.

No domain-specific transient data elements extend the common restore operations beyond those defined in the (#restore-ops).

# IANA Considerations

## RPP Data Object Registry

This document establishes the "RESTful Provisioning Protocol (RPP) Data Object Registry". This registry serves as a catalogue of all data objects, component objects, data elements, and operations used within RPP.

### Registration Policy

The policy for adding new objects, data elements, or operations to this registry is "Specification Required" [@!RFC8126].

Standardised RPP extensions that introduce new data objects, add data elements to existing objects, or define new operations or operation parameters MUST register these additions in this registry. Each such registration MUST reference the specification that defines the extension.

Private (non-standardised) extensions are not required to register in this registry.

### Registry Structure

The registry is organised as a collection of Object definitions. Each Object definition MUST include:

* A header containing the Object Identifier, Object Name, Object Type (Resource, Process or Component), a brief description, and a reference to its defining specification.

* A "Data Elements" table listing all persisted data elements associated with the object. Each entry MUST specify the element's Identifier, Name, Cardinality, Mutability, Data Type, description, and a reference to the specification that defines it.

* An "Operations" section (applicable only for Object Types Resource or Process). For each operation, the
registry MUST provide:
  * The Operation's Name, a description, and a reference to the specification that defines it.
  * A "Parameters" table listing all data elements that are provided as input to the operation but are not persisted as part of the object's state. Each entry MUST specify the parameter's Identifier, Name, Cardinality, Data Type, description, and a reference to the specification that defines it.

Extensions MAY add new data elements, operations, or operation parameters to existing Object definitions in the registry. Each such addition MUST reference the extension specification that introduces it, allowing implementations to distinguish core protocol elements from extension-defined elements.
